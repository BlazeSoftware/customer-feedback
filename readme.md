# Customer Feedback

A framework free and themeable web component that captures an annotated screenshot and description of a web page.

## Getting Started

#### Vanilla HTML

Add the following to the `head` of the document.

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@blaze/customer-feedback/dist/customer-feedback/customer-feedback.esm.js"
  type="module"
></script>
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@blaze/customer-feedback/dist/customer-feedback/customer-feedback.js"
  nomodule
></script>
```

Place this web component at the bottom of the body element:

```html
<customer-feedback></customer-feedback>
```

_Under the hood customer-feedback uses it's position in HTML and a high z-index to ensure it remains on top of the content of your web page, however you may still experience layering issues if you have similar code that overlays all content._

### React

If you'd like to use this component inside a React app firstly install the package:

```bash
npm i @blaze/customer-feedback
```

then add the following code to the start up routine (usually index.js):

```js
import { applyPolyfills, defineCustomElements } from 'customer-feedback/loader';

//...

await applyPolyfills();
defineCustomElements();
```

```
